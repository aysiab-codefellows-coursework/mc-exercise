# Merge Conflict Exercise
### Collaborated with Seth, Ashley & Brendan 

Alot of the group's conflicts could have been avoided by doing a `git pull origin master` to everyone's machines. This would hav ensured that everyone was working in sync on the most up to date working code before divvying up into different feature branches which ultimately lead to merge conflicts.
